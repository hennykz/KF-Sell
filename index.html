The absence of red flags or manager notes suggests few blockers, though final terms on rev-share remain the primary unknown. The Next Step shows Pat is negotiating rev-share today (9/10/25), signaling active movement toward signature. The deal will rely on rapid alignment of rev-share terms with finance and legal to protect the forecast and avoid last-minute delays. The KF score of 73 indicates strong alignment and readiness to close if terms are accepted.</td>

<td>York Hospital Ambient Scribe is in Final Contract Execution with a Best Case forecast and an ACV of $156,000. The deal is positioned for close by 9/30/25, with the current Next Step indicating the contract is expected next week and Nexus registration is in process. KF score is 72, suggesting solid but not peak confidence; there are no manager notes or Bluesheet data to corroborate readiness. Without visible Red Flags or bluesheet inputs, the primary risk remains timing-related contract execution that could derail the Best Case forecast if dependencies slip. A rigorous, expedited review with legal and procurement, plus a confirmed signature date and Nexus alignment, should help preserve the forecast.</td>

<td>Beebe Medical Center shows a Best Case forecast with a relatively modest $135,000 ACV and a KF score of 37. Manager Forecast Notes highlight a budget approval this week, an EOY go-live for an Epic project, and a potential funding fallback from the CEO if finance does not approve, with VP of Security as a champion. The combination points to meaningful executive engagement but also notable dependency on timely budget and Epic project milestones. The key risk is timing: delays in budget and milestone alignment could push the go-live date beyond the initial plan. If budget approvals land as described and the Epic project status aligns, the deal could close on the intended timeline.</td>

<td>Shore Medical Center is in the Proposal/Price Quote stage with a Best Case forecast and a KF score of 24. The deal value is $65,000 and the target close date is the end of October, indicating moderate urgency but some risk of delay as final terms are negotiated. There are currently no Manager Notes or Blue Sheet inputs to sharpen the narrative, so progress hinges on advancing the external discussions.
